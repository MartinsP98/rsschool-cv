### Summary
After studying in Latvia at Priekuli Technical School, I joined the military. While my military years have provided valuable experiences, I now wish to return to my roots in computer science. I have a keen interest in computer science and am determined to update my knowledge, taking a step back into the field. I am ready to put in the effort to continue my education in this area, developing my skills for a career change that aligns with my passion for computer science.
